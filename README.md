# IO Project

Three "histories" prepared for IO classes.

## Getting Started

Three programming tasks merged into one project:
* Searching for dependencies between .cpp and .h source files.
* Searching for dependencies between functions/methods in the source files.
* Searching for dependencies between a set of classes, functions or methods.

## Libraries

* [BOOST](https://www.boost.org/doc/) - Free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

## Authors

* **Jan Sadecki**
* **Mariusz Matusik**
* **Mateusz Orzechowski**

* **Jakub Haberka**
* **Robert Bylica**

## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to our lecturer for inspiring ideas for programming and familiarizing with the issue of software engineering.
