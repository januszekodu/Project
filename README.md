# IO Project

Three "histories" prepared for IO classes.

## Getting Started

Three programming tasks merged into one project:
* Searching for dependencies between .cpp and .h source files.
* Searching for dependencies between functions/methods in the source files.
* Searching for dependencies between a set of classes, functions or methods.

## Libraries

* [BOOST](https://www.boost.org/doc/) - Free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
* [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/documentation/) - Graph Visualization Software.

## Install

Before running project you need to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) and [BOOST](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) library.
